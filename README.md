ajax_django
===========

A simple wrapper written on top of jquery to make making AJAX requests to Django Servers easier. Django needs a csrf token to receive any POST request. The ajax_upload.js file has the functions to add csrf tokens to the header of the request. This allows easier and less time consuming Ajax requests.
